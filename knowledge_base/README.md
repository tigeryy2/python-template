# Knowledge Base

Short reference docs for recurring workflows and implementation decisions.
Each article should include YAML frontmatter with `last_read`, `usefulness`, and `read_win_tags` for filtering.

## Contents
- `list_kb.py`: List KB articles by tag match, usefulness, and last_read.
- `kb_article_template.md`: Starter template for new KB articles.

## Notes
- This template keeps only KB scaffolding by default.
- Add project-specific KB articles as implementation knowledge accumulates.
